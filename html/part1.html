                    <em>La Albiceleste</em> looked to be in control for most of the match and were two goals to the good by half-time, thanks to Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria. However, France produced a stirring late comeback inspired by two goals from star man Kylian Mbappé.

                <p class="pb-3">
                    During a breathless and breath-taking extra time, Argentina regained the lead with Messi's second goal, only for Mbappé to level once again. Ultimately, the match was decided by penalties, with Gonzalo Montiel clinching Argentina's historic triumph.
